## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### Service Layer Design
```python
# Example: Clean service interface
class YouTubeService(LoggerMixin):
    @cache_manager.cache_result("youtube_transcript", ttl=86400)
    def get_transcript(self, video_id: str) -> str:
        # Implementation with error handling and performance monitoring
```

### Configuration Management
```python
# Type-safe configuration with validation
class APISettings(BaseSettings):
    openai_api_key: str = Field(..., env="OPENAI_API_KEY")
    groq_model: str = Field(default="llama-3.3-70b-versatile")
    
    class Config:
        env_file = ".env"
```

### Error Handling Strategy
```python
# Custom exception hierarchy
class RAGApplicationError(Exception):
    def __init__(self, message: str, error_code: Optional[str] = None):
        self.message = message
        self.error_code = error_code
        super().__init__(self.message)
```
